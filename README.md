##Google Search Front-End
The project involves creating HTML forms using the <form> tag and adding <input> tags to create input fields for the forms. The forms will be used to send data to an existing web server, in this case, Google's.

We will be using the query string to submit information to the web server. The query string consists of a sequence of GET parameters, where each parameter has a name and a value. These parameters are a way for forms to submit information to a web server, by encoding the form data in the UR.
